**Connect FilePulse** is a multipurpose, scalable and reliable, 
[Kafka Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) that makes it easy to parse, transform and stream any file, in any format, into Apache Kafka‚Ñ¢.
It provides capabilities for reading files from: **local-filesystem**, **Amazon S3**, **Azure Storage** and **Google Cloud Storage**. 

## Motivation

In organizations, data is frequently exported, shared and integrated from legacy systems through the use of
files in a wide variety of formats (e.g. CSV, XML, JSON, Avro, etc.). Dealing with all of these formats can
quickly become a real challenge for enterprise that usually end up with a complex and hard
to maintain data integration mess.
	
	
A modern approach consists in building a scalable data streaming platform as a central nervous
system to decouple applications from each other. **Apache Kafka‚Ñ¢** is one of the most widely
used technologies to build such a system. The Apache Kafka project packs with Kafka Connect a distributed,
fault tolerant and scalable framework for connecting Kafka with external systems.

The **Connect File Pulse** project aims to provide an easy-to-use solution, based on Kafka Connect,
for streaming any type of data file with the Apache Kafka‚Ñ¢ platform.

Some of the features of Connect File Pulse are inspired by the ingestion capabilities of **Elasticsearch** and **Logstash**.

## üöÄ Key Features Overview

Connect FilePulse provides a set of built-in features for streaming files from multiple filesystems into Kafka. This includes, among other things:

* Support for recursive scanning of local directories.
* Support for reading files from Amazon S3, Azure Storage and Google Cloud Storage.
* Support multiple input file formats (e.g: CSV, JSON, AVRO, XML).
* Support for Grok expressions.
* Parsing and transforming data using built-in or custom processing filters.
* Error handler definition
* Monitoring files while they are being written into Kafka
* Support pluggable strategies to clean up completed files
* Etc.
